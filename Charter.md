# Project Charter: Project Unload

* Vision: With this capstone project, we plan to create a website that can track the number of trailers each employee unloads throughout a shift. As part of the project, we plan to create a leaderboard for employees to track their progress. Based on the leaderboard, we will implement a reward system for the top three employees quarterly.

##### Edited vision by Laina read over and decide if you want to keep original or use this revised one. 
* The goal of this capstone project is to create a website or app. The goal is for managers to track the number of trailers unloaded each shift by employees and enter them effortlessly into the website or app. A leaderboard that displays employees' names and progress is one of the outcomes of this project. Based on the leaderboard, we will implement a reward system for the top three employees quarterly. 
*Project Start Date: 3/08/2022
*Final Project Charter Completion Date: 3/16/2022
*Projected Full Completion Date: 05/31/2022
## Project Objectives
1. Tracking how many trailers an employee unloads on a single shift. 
2. Create a 1st, 2nd, 3rd place for a reward system for the company that is based on employees with the highest number of trailers unloaded.
3. Create a feature for a website that pulls data from SQL to the website and adds up the number of trailers unloaded for each employee.
4. Achievements/rewards for the number of trailers unloaded like a shout out on the leaderboard.
   1. Ie first 10 
   2. First 100 
   3. Making it to 1000
5. Add happy birthday callout to the leaderboard. (this might be out of scope)
## Key Scheduled Milestones
* First working solution of Project Unload presented to our stakeholders. 
* Middle level solution for Project Unload.
* Working leaderboard for employees
* Project completion about May 31st
##High Level Approach
* Combination of HTML/CSS/Python to create a website or app that pulls from a database. Will utilize HTML/CSS to create most of the website.
SQL used (most likely mariaDB) to create our Database that stores basic employee information along with tracking trailers unloaded.
## Product Backlog
* PB006: Gives 1st, 2nd, 3rd place for reward system, based on the amount of trailers unloaded. 
  * Success Criteria: Shows 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place employees on the website for the most amount of trailers unloaded.
* PB007: Leaderboard on website based on number of trailers that each employee unloaded. 
   * Success Criteria: Lists top employees based on most trailers unloaded.
